Do you need an LED? The answer is always yes. But what if you need one right **now**? Build yourself an LED gumball machine and never run out again!

This machine was created for the [CU BTU lab](http://btulab.com) because students constantly needed LEDs but filling parts bins always seemed to fall to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). We’d put 1,000 LEDs into the bin and they’d be gone in less than 2 weeks. With the Gumball LED dispenser the LEDs last for more than a semester. It’s amazing how much a 15 second pause will cause people to think twice.

This repo is the software that runs on the Gumball Machine. You can read the full tutorial [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-gumball-machine).
